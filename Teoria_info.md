### Issues with 2FA Methods:

SMS and Call based OTPs rely on SIM cards, which can be duplicated.  
Software based 2FA methods are as secure as the token generating algorithm.  
Hardware-based 2FA methods are useful only if they are not physically accessible by any other person except their Original user.  
Backup codes can be easily obtained if stored in unsafe places.  
Biometric authentication characteristics can be duplicated and hence bypassed.
